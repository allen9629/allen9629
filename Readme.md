Hi,
My name is Allen Lim Jun Hong, currently a master student at Tsinghua University, China, pursuing for MEng.
My main focus is on developing medical rehabilitation robot control algorithms and methods, to help stroke/PD patients to be independent during rehabilitation training.

I am developing my robots based on Robot Operating System (ROS) framework, complied with safety control algorithms.
